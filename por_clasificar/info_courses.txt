Introduction to Computer Science on edx.org, its MIT 6.001 taught by professor Eric Grimson.

Best way imo, basically a free MIT course. Id recommend going to colab.research.google.com as well to practice the coding you lesrn in your videos. Its an online pytjon coding environment. also free.


Good place to start for learning your way around is:

-learn python the hard way (python 3)

-automate the boring stuff

Then progress to:

-the MIT course on open courseware is a good intro to computer science in python. The focus is computer science though (algos and problem solving), not simply coding in python, even though the course is entirely python based.

From there you will want to learn how to use numpy, scipy, Jupyter notebooks etc. It will depend on what you are doing. There is a never ending cycle of googling and stack overflow to help you get through.

Colt Steele's course on Udemy
Colt's course is good. Personally I've used a combination of his and other courses. Combine his course with Fred Baptise's courses.
